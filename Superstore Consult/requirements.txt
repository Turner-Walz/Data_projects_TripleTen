Project: Superstore Data Visualization  
Context: Youâ€™ve been hired to analyze the operations of a superstore to identify ways to boost profitability and avoid bankruptcy. Your task is to create visualizations that answer key business questions across three areas:

1. Profits & Losses
Identify the top 2 profit centers and 2 biggest loss-makers (e.g., by subcategory, region, or shipping mode).
Recommend products and subcategories to stop selling and focus on (3 each).

2. Advertising
Find the 3 best state-month combinations for advertising and visualize monthly profit trends.
Calculate an advertising budget using 1/5 of profits as a guide.

3. Returned Items
Analyze product and customer return rates using a calculated field for returns.
Create a visualization comparing profit vs. return rate by a chosen dimension (e.g., state or product type) and recommend actions based on the findings.
Deliverables
Provide clear, actionable insights with visualizations for each question. Support your recommendations with data and ensure the superstore's operations are optimized for profitability.
