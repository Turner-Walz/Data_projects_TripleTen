Project Overview: SQL Analysis for Zuber
Context: This project simulates the role of an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago. The goal is to analyze ride-sharing data, identify patterns in passenger preferences, and assess the impact of external factors like weather on ride frequency and duration.

Project Requirements
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the number of taxi rides by company for specific date ranges.
Focus on key companies (“Yellow,” “Blue,” Flash Cab, and Taxi Affiliation Services).
Aggregate data for smaller companies under the group "Other."
Sort and display results based on ride frequency.

2. Weather Impact Analysis
Compare ride durations from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays versus other days and conditions.
Categorize weather conditions as "Bad" (e.g., rain, storms) or "Good" based on weather descriptions.
Filter rides by neighborhood (Loop and O'Hare) and match weather records to rides using timestamps.
Retrieve ride durations for analysis, excluding records without weather data.

3. Database Use and Query Design
Work with multiple database tables: neighborhoods, cabs, trips, and weather_records.
Use JOIN operations to connect rides and weather data via timestamps.
Employ SQL techniques like CASE, GROUP BY, and sorting to organize results.
