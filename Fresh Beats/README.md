# File Title: Fresh Beats Status Report

This was my first project from the TripleTen Buisness Analytics program. It is a project to turn an anlysis into a report presentation. 

Fresh Beats is a music streaming platform catering to listeners and up-and-coming musicians. It offers music streaming and helps new artists gain exposure through promotional services. The platform faces challenges in optimizing these areas:

Ensuring artist promotions are effective and deliver value for musicians.
Converting free listeners into paying subscribers.
Recommending music effectively, especially for highlighting new artists in relevant genres.

#### Description:
- Microsoft Excel, 3 page project.
- Insights, recommendations, and charts to support the insight and recommendations are all included in this report. 

#### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- `'sprint 0  BIA Welcome Sprint Project. Fresh Beats User Data'`: each row corresponds to one cross-dimensional category.
    - `'year'`: year data was obtained for each dimension
    - `'user_tier'`: Boolean data categorizing if the users were Free or Paid Subscribers
    - `'genre'`: specifies a string of data for the type of genre that was listened to
    - `'number_of_users'`: The SUM of all users for each dimension
    - `'tracks_listened'`: The SUM of all music plays for each dimension

A Google Doc with a template for the project was provided. Blank Sections included:
- `'Summary'`
- `'Insights'`
- `'Recommendations'`
- `'Visualizations'`
- `'Conclusion'`

#### Assumptions:
 Data Availability: The project assumes that all the necessary data for analyzing user engagement and business challenges is available in the provided dataset spreadsheet.
- Data Accuracy: The project assumes that the data in the spreadsheet is accurate and reflects the user behavior on the Fresh Beats platform.
- Insights and Visualizations Quality: The project assumes that the provided insights and visualizations are reliable and accurately represent the data within the spreadsheet.
- Report Template Suitability: The project assumes that the provided report template is appropriate for presenting the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.


#### Findings:
-The analysis showed that there are a couple of genres to dive deeper into, to find the root cause of the incline or decline of sales. Also it shows that rock is going to be a key genre to invest more into as they have a high rate of unpaid users, and a lot of potential to get more paid users.

#### Recommendations/Results:
Take this report and create marketing campaigns to geared towards rock listeners, and also create another study to see if we can find out more of the reason why other genres may be doing better or worse.

#### Notes:
This project was submitted and approved from the first iteration by the reviewers of TripleTen.
