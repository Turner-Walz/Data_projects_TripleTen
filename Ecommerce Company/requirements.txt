Project Overview: Turning Event Logs into Business Metrics
Context: This project was completed as part of a bootcamp to simulate the role of a junior analyst at an e-commerce company, where the goal is to analyze raw transaction logs and derive meaningful business insights. Key deliverables include creating a conversion funnel, preparing cohort analysis data, calculating retention rates, and presenting findings in a polished and professional format.

Project Requirements
1. Build a Conversion Funnel
Objective: Analyze how effectively the website converts product page views into purchases.
Steps:
Create a 3-stage conversion funnel in a pivot table, counting unique users at each stage.
Add columns for total conversion rates and step-by-step conversion rates using formulas.

2. Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis
Objective: Group users into acquisition cohorts based on the month of their first purchase and track cohort behavior over time.
Steps:
Filter purchase events into a new sheet, "purchase_activity."
Calculate first purchase dates for each user using a pivot table and the VLOOKUP function.
Add columns to group data by event month, first purchase month, and cohort age using spreadsheet functions like TEXT() and DATEDIF().

3. Calculate Retention Rates
Objective: Measure user retention for each cohort over a 4-month period.
Steps:
Group data into cohorts in a pivot table on the "cohort_analysis" sheet.
Create a new "retention_rates" sheet to calculate and display retention rates for each cohort and cohort age.
Use fixed column references in formulas to calculate rates consistently.

4. Organize and Document the Spreadsheet
Objective: Ensure the spreadsheet is professional, easy to navigate, and clearly communicates findings.
Steps:
Summarize results and key analyses in the "Executive Summary" sheet.
Add a "Table of Contents" sheet with an organized sheet order and descriptions.
Format the spreadsheet for readability: apply borders, bold headers, freeze rows, and highlight calculated cells.
