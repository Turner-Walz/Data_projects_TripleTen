#### Description:
- This project format was in excel and has nine sheets in total.
- Includes organizational tabs, raw data (Hidden), processed data, data analysis, pivot tables, and bar charts.

#### Process:
1) **Data Preparation**: *Filtering* techniques were used to identify and clean inconsistencies within the Airbnb data. Irrelevant columns were hidden to maintain a focused analysis. Key functions such as PROPER, TRIM, IF, ISNUMBER, FIND, ROUND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and WEEKDAY were employed for data tidying.
2) **Neighborhood Analysis**: Identify the top-performing neighborhoods based on review frequency via *Pivot Table*.
3) **Property Size Analysis**: Determine the optimal property sizes for each neighborhoodvia *Pivot Table* showcased with *conditional formatting*.
4) **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate estimated annual revenue for the most attractive listings.
5) **Additional Optional Analysis**: Perform Analysis through *Pivot Tables* for occupancy rates by day, price by super host status, check-in ratings by use of doormen, and price by review ratings.
6) **Data Visualization**: Create clear and informative *visualizations* (charts) to present findings.
7) **Formatting and Organization**: Ensure your analysis is well-formatted for ease of readability.
8) **Documentation**: Create organizational sheets like an executive summary, table of contents, assumptions log, and change log.

#### Data
The data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen.
- `'nyc_airbnb_data.csv'`: each row corresponds to one listing on Airbnb in September 2022
    - `'data_dictionary'`: summary of field titles seen in the file and its data type
    - `'listings'`: uniquely listings available with all available data
    - `'calendar'`: listings with upcoming availabilities and date-type data

#### Assumptions:
- Data only reflects a one month period in the year 2022 from September 7th to October 6th. Other months were not considered.
- To generate the occupency of a listing, we assume 1 review from a client = 1 stay at a Airbnb property for data that was taken over the last 12 months. 


#### Findings:
- The three most attractive neighborhoods were Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, and Harlem.
- The 3 most popular property sizes by number of bedrooms were studios, single bedrooms, and 2 bedrooms.
- The listing ID 49946551 was the top-earning listing as seen on pivot table name: Top Revenue by Listing Pivot Table.


#### Notes:
Project was accepted as is by reviewer from the first itteration of the project.
