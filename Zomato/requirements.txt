Project Overview: Sales Analysis for Zomato
As a Junior Analyst at Zomato, I conducted a Sales Analysis to assess the company's revenue trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and sales distribution over time. Using Excel, I explored and cleaned the dataset, performed calculations, and identified patterns. I then leveraged Tableau to create interactive visualizations that provide actionable insights into sales performance.

The goal was to understand the dynamics of Zomatoâ€™s sales, identify key revenue drivers, and uncover trends that could help improve business strategies.

Project Requirements
To successfully complete this project, I needed to:
âœ… Select one of the three analysis typesâ€”Customer, Restaurant, or Sales (chose Sales Analysis).
âœ… Develop a structured research plan (Decomposition) outlining key questions, hypotheses, and required visualizations.
âœ… Analyze provided datasets, which included food, menu, orders, restaurant, and users tables.
âœ… Use Excel for data exploration, cleaning, and calculations.
âœ… Build an interactive Tableau dashboard that effectively visualizes findings.
âœ… Summarize insights into a final report, including conclusions and business recommendations.

Project Deliverables
ðŸ“Œ Decomposition (Project Plan) â€“ A structured breakdown of the research process, including objectives, hypotheses, chosen metrics, and planned visualizations.
ðŸ“Œ Dashboard (Tableau Visualizations) â€“ A fully interactive sales performance dashboard highlighting revenue trends, key metrics, and sales distribution insights.
ðŸ“Œ Final Report (Business Insights & Recommendations) â€“ A document or presentation summarizing findings, key takeaways, and strategic recommendations for improving Zomatoâ€™s sales performance.
