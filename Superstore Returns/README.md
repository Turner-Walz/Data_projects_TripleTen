#### Description:
- This project aims to analyze the high number of returned orders at the Superstore. The objective is to identify key factors contributing to returns and develop a data-driven strategy to reduce return rates. The final deliverables will include an analysis report, an interactive Tableau dashboard, and a presentation for the CEO of the Superstore.

#### Process:

Data Preparation:
- Join the Returns table with the Orders table using a LEFT JOIN.
- Create a calculated field for returns (1 for returned orders, 0 for non-returned orders).
- Aggregate data by various dimensions (category, customer, geography, time 

#### Data
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
1️⃣ '`Orders'` Contains details of all purchases, including order ID, customer ID, product ID, sales amount, and order date.<br/>
2️⃣ '`Returns'` Specifies which orders were returned, linked by order ID.<br/>
3️⃣ '`Products'` Contains product information, including category and subcategory.<br/>
4️⃣ '`Customers'` Provides customer segmentation data.<br/>
5️⃣ '`Geography'` Includes location-based data to analyze return trends by region.<br/>

#### Assumptions:
- We only used the data that was given to us for this project along with the tools Excel and Tableau. 


#### Findings:
- The return rates can be tied to certain outlying customers having super high return rates, specific states returning more product than others, and specfici times of year that seem to lead to products getting returned more. 

#### Recommendations/Results:
- Conduct future studies diving into our high return areas to see what things specifically that could be changed to decrease overall returns.
