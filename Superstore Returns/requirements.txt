Time chart: Seasonal patterns in returns.
Composite charts: Combine multiple factors (e.g., geography & time).
Customer Analysis: Identify customers with high return rates (exclude single-order customers).

2. Build the Returns Dashboard
Create 3 mock-up sketches, select the best, and design a Tableau dashboard.
Include charts, filters, and user-friendly features to monitor returns.

3. Present Findings
Summarize analysis with key insights on root causes.
Recommend actionable steps to reduce returns.
Deliver a 3â€“5 minute Tableau Story presentation or submit a PDF with slides.
