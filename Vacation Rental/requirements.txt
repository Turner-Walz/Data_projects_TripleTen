Project Overview: Business Metrics Analysis
Context: This project was completed as part of a bootcamp to simulate the role of a junior analyst helping a client with their next investment. The objective was to analyze user activity data and deliver actionable insights through metrics and reports.

Project Requirements
1. Conversion Funnel Analysis
Create a 3-stage funnel to track user activity (e.g., views → actions → purchases).
Calculate overall and stage-by-stage conversion rates.
Present results in a dedicated sheet for clarity.

2. Cohort Analysis Preparation
Isolate relevant user activity data (e.g., purchase events).
Determine first activity dates to group users into cohorts.
Add calculated fields (e.g., activity month, cohort age) to support analysis.

3. Retention Rate Calculation
Group users by cohorts based on their first activity.
Calculate and display retention rates for each cohort across multiple time periods.
Use tables to show user retention trends.

4. Documentation and Presentation
Summarize findings in an executive summary with key results and methodology.
Organize sheets for logical flow (summary → results → calculations → raw data).
Format the spreadsheet for professional readability and usability.
